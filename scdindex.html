                    Slow-witted Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has never thought of himself as disadvantaged,
                    and thanks to his supportive mother (Sally Field),
                    he leads anything but a restricted life.
                    Whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star,
                    fighting in Vietnam or captaining a shrimp boat,
                    Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism.
                    But one person Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his childhood love,
                    the sweet but troubled Jenny (Robin Wright).
